# drag-n-drop-gui
PyQt5 implemented GUI for dragging MS Word documents into a widget as input.

I work an office job involving lots of MS Word documents and lots of repetitive tasks that could be automated. Much of these tasks involve text analysis jobs that don't require the Word documents to be altered. I also did not want to deal with Word macros, and I very much preferred to work with Python. 

This is the solution that I came up with in the office: a simple PyQt5 widget with check boxes to toggle between four different functions, or analytic tasks to perform on the Word document. You select a check box, drag and drop a Word document or plain-text document into the GUI box, and a result is generated in the form of a text file.
